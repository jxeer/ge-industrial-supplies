PRIORITY 1 – Homepage Adjustments
1. Move Certifications to Homepage

Under the “Engage With Us” button on the homepage, add a credentials strip that includes:

    UEI
    CAGE Code
    Bonding: 30M Single / 100M Aggregate

This should appear:

    Directly under the CTA
    Clean, horizontal layout
    Highly visible
    Not cluttered

Additionally: Add the bonding line permanently in the footer across all pages.

Footer format: Bonding: 30M Single / 100M Aggregate
PRIORITY 2 – Core Capabilities Visibility
A. Add Construction to Core Capabilities Grid

On the homepage “Core Capabilities” section:

    Add “Construction” visibly in the grid.
    Remove “Food Service Operations & Logistics” from the homepage grid (can remain on full services page).
    Ensure Construction appears immediately when scrolling — no “View All” required.

Goal: Agencies should immediately see “Construction” without clicking deeper.
PRIORITY 3 – Contract Vehicles Section Corrections
A. Remove GSA as Active

    Change GSA from Active to “Pending”
    Color the word “Pending” yellow
    Do NOT show as Active

B. Add Prime Attribution

For contracts where G&E was not prime:

Add prime contractor attribution after agency name using slash format:

Example: Great Lakes Naval-AC-PRI / Vectrus Systems Corporation

Vectrus spelling: V-E-C-T-R-U-S Systems Corporation

All Middle East work → attribute to Vectrus.
C. Add Additional NAICS Codes

Under Contract Vehicles section (where NAICS codes are already listed), add:

NAICS 236220 (Construction)
NAICS 541330 (Mechanical Engineering)

Keep formatting consistent with existing NAICS display.
PRIORITY 4 – Log-CAP Construction Clarification

Under Log-CAP description: Incorporate construction retrofitting language to reflect:

    Building modifications
    Retrofitting
    Infrastructure adaptation for housing rescuees

This supports NAICS 236220 positioning.

Do not expand heavily. Just ensure construction scope is captured.
PRIORITY 5 – About Page Language Alignment

Replace “About Us” language with:

The updated language Melissa previously emailed.

Ensure:

    Company Overview wording matches her federal-aligned language.
    O&M and Facility Support terminology matches latest direction.
    Remove outdated phrasing.

Consistency matters more than volume.
PRIORITY 6 – Executive Leadership Section

Structure must support:

Executive Leadership
Administrative
Engineers

Do NOT remove anyone.

Update:

    Remove Melissa as Primary Point of Contact.
    Replace POC with Jeff (President).
    Update footer contact email accordingly.
    Melissa remains in Executive Leadership with bio intact.

PRIORITY 7 – Footer Updates (Global)

Footer must include:

    UEI
    CAGE Code
    Bonding: 30M Single / 100M Aggregate
    Updated primary contact (Jeff)

This must carry across all pages.
